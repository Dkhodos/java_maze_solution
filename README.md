# Maze Solver

This project provides a set of search algorithms to solve a maze. The maze is represented as a grid, where each cell can either be a walkable path or an obstacle. The goal is to find a path from a starting point to an end point.

- for input: `data/maze_scenario_2.txt` output: `outputs/maze_scenario_2.txt`

### Project Structure:
- üìÅ **.github** - GitHub actions for automatic test (CI).
- üìÅ **.idea** - IntelliJ project files
- üìÅ **data** - possible inputs for the Main program.
- üìÅ **outputs** - outputs for the possible inputs for the Main program.
- üìÅ **reports** - HTML report template, and the folder that the temp reports are generated for.
- üìÅ **src** - the actual Java code.
- üìÅ **static** - a resource folder, mostly for the readme and the reports.
- üìÅ **tests** - tests folder, with its own test data.
- üìÑ **java_maze_solution.iml** - class path dependencies (for IntelliJ projects).

## Features

- **Search Algorithms**: The project includes multiple search algorithms:
  - A* Search: Uses a combination of the cost to reach a node and a heuristic to estimate the cost from that node to the goal.
  - Greedy Search: Expands the node that is estimated to be closest to the goal using a heuristic.
  - Uniform Cost Search: Expands the node with the lowest path cost.
- **Maze Parser**: Parses a maze from a file.
- **Report Generation**: Generates an HTML report based on a given solution path through the maze.
- **Search Executor**: Executes a list of search algorithms on a given maze, logs the execution time, displays the results, and generates a report for each algorithm.
- **Maze Generator**: Generates random mazes based on a given difficulty level.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for the search algorithms, maze parser, maze functionalities, and maze path reconstruction.

## Classes

- **Maze**: Represents a grid-based maze with nodes.
- **Node**: Represents a point in the maze.
- **MazePath**: Represents a path through a maze using a map to store the relationship between a node and its predecessor in the path.
- **SearchAlgorithm**: An abstract class that provides the base for search algorithms.
- **Logger**: Provides color-coded console logging.
- **MazeParser**: Parses a maze from a file.
- **ReportMaker**: Generates an HTML report.
- **SearchExecutor**: Executes search algorithms and generates reports.
- **SearchResult**: Holds the result of a search algorithm.
- **MazeGenerator**: Generates random mazes.

## Install Dependencies
- Dependencies are located in `java_maze_solution.iml`.

### Maze Generator (tests/MazeGenerator.java)
- Run main in `java MazeGenerator.java`, you may adjust the size and difficulty in the main method.

## Tests
- **AStarTest**:
  - `testSolve`: Checks if the A* algorithm can solve a basic maze.
  - `testSolveUnsolvableMaze`: Validates that the A* algorithm correctly identifies an unsolvable maze.
  - `testSolveBigMaze`: Tests the A* algorithm's performance and correctness on a larger maze.

- **GreedySearchTest**:
  - `testSolve`: Checks if the Greedy algorithm can solve a basic maze.
  - `testSolveUnsolvableMaze`: Validates that the Greedy algorithm correctly identifies an unsolvable maze.
  - `testSolveBigMaze`: Tests the Greedy algorithm's performance and correctness on a larger maze.

- **UniformCostSearchTest**:
  - `testSolve`: Checks if the Uniform Cost Search algorithm can solve a basic maze.
  - `testSolveUnsolvableMaze`: Validates that the Uniform Cost Search algorithm correctly identifies an unsolvable maze.
  - `testSolveBigMaze`: Tests the Uniform Cost Search algorithm's performance and correctness on a larger maze.

- **MazeParserTest**:
  - `testParseMaze`: Validates that the maze parser correctly reads and interprets a maze file.
  - `testEmptyFile`: Checks the parser's behavior when provided with an empty file.
  - `testSizeMissingFile`: Validates the parser's behavior when the maze size is missing from the file.

- **MazeTest**:
  - `testGetNeighbors`: Checks if the maze correctly identifies the neighbors of a given node, considering obstacles.

- **MazePathTest**:
  - `testAdd`: Validates the addition of nodes and their predecessors to the path.
  - `testGetReconstructPathDataExists`: Checks the correct reconstruction of the path when data exists.
  - `testGetReconstructPathEmpty`: Validates the behavior when trying to reconstruct a path with no data.
  - `testGetReconstructPathSorted`: Ensures the reconstructed path is correctly sorted.
- **FrontierTest**:
  - `testIsEmpty`: Validates the behavior of the isEmpty method.
  - `testDequeue`: Checks the correct dequeue operation and order.
  - `testRemove`: Validates the removal of specific nodes from the frontier.

### To run the tests:

- Use stock IntelliJ / Eclipse test runner.

## Github CI
- Check `.github/workflows/tests.yaml`.

## Notes
- The maze file should start with a number indicating the size of the maze, followed by the maze grid where `0` represents a walkable path and `1` represents an obstacle.
- The reports are generated as HTML files and can be viewed in a web browser.
- This project is using the **Record** keyword which were introduced in `Java 14`: https://www.baeldung.com/java-record-keyword
